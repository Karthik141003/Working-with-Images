Introduction
Image processing is a crucial aspect of various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, remote sensing, and more. Python provides a variety of libraries and tools that make it easy to perform tasks like reading, manipulating, and analyzing images.

This repository aims to provide examples and guides for performing common image processing tasks using Python. It covers everything from basic operations like opening and displaying images to more advanced tasks like object detection and image analysis.

Getting Started
To get started with image processing in Python, you'll need the following:

Python (3.6 or later)
Pip (Python package manager)
Virtual environment (recommended)
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Karthik141003/image-processing-python.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd image-processing-python
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Basic Image Operations
Learn how to perform basic operations on images such as reading, displaying, and saving images. The examples cover libraries like Pillow (PIL) and OpenCV.

python
Copy code
from PIL import Image
import cv2

# Open and display an image using PIL
image_pil = Image.open("example.jpg")
image_pil.show()

# Open and display an image using OpenCV
image_cv2 = cv2.imread("example.jpg")
cv2.imshow("Image", image_cv2)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Image Filtering
Explore techniques for applying filters to images to achieve effects like blurring, sharpening, and edge detection.

python
Copy code
import cv2

image = cv2.imread("example.jpg")

# Apply Gaussian blur
blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)

# Apply edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(image, threshold1=30, threshold2=70)
Image Transformation
Learn how to perform geometric transformations on images, including resizing, rotating, and cropping.

python
Copy code
import cv2

image = cv2.imread("example.jpg")

# Resize the image
resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (width, height))

# Rotate the image
rotation_matrix = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center, angle, scale)
rotated_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, rotation_matrix, (width, height))
Object Detection
Discover techniques for detecting objects within images using pre-trained models and libraries like OpenCV.

python
Copy code
import cv2

# Load pre-trained classifier (e.g., face detection)
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier("haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")

image = cv2.imread("people.jpg")
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=4)
Image Enhancement
Learn how to enhance image quality using techniques like histogram equalization and contrast adjustment.

python
Copy code
import cv2

image = cv2.imread("dark_image.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply histogram equalization
equalized_image = cv2.equalizeHist(image)

# Adjust contrast using CLAHE
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8, 8))
enhanced_image = clahe.apply(image)
Image Analysis
Explore techniques for analyzing images, such as finding contours, computing image gradients, and extracting color information.

python
Copy code
import cv2

image = cv2.imread("shapes.jpg")
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Find contours
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(gray_image, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Compute image gradients
gradient_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
gradient_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
